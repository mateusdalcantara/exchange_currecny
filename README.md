<h1 align="center">💰Exchange Currency Project💵</h1>

> #### :mag_right: Description 📢
> - The code makes a request to an API called ExchangeRate-API.
>
> - This API is responsible for returning the conversion of a specific value of a currency
>   (base currency like BRL) to the equivalent value in the
>   exchange rate of another currency (target currency like USD).
>
> #### :red_circle: Instructions :red_circle:
>
>  - You will need to set the amount of money first and then you will choose the operations BRL to USD, USD to BRL, etc.
>  - If you set the amount of money as 10.000,00 or 10000 and choose the first option, to convert the base currency (BRL) to the target
>    currency (USD), it will divide 10.000,00 by 5.14 and will output $1.945,52 and the rate will be 0,1945525291828794.
>  - In this code I place many of try-catch blocks, so don't use the currency Brazilian numerations like 10,000.00
>    because it won't work and will ask the correct value again, like 10.000,00 or 10000.
>  - You must set the API key in a file at the root of the code for it to work. The file should be
>    named apiKey.txt and it should contain the API key without quotes (“”).
>  - Attention, the rate may change in the future. The current exchange rate (04/29/2024) from BRL to USD is 5.14.
